Description: libkrunfw -- runtime
 libkrunfw is a library bundling a Linux kernel in a dynamic library in a way
 that can be easily consumed by libkrun.
 .
 By having the kernel bundled in a dynamic library, libkrun can leave to the
 linker the work of mapping the sections into the process, and then directly
 inject those mappings into the guest without any kind of additional work nor
 processing.
